This is a list of the various tools I have found helpful over the years

## Software Development
* [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/)
 * An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree of source code where the top is the whole file, the bottom are the smallest pieces like primitive variables, and the rest is in between. ASTs are very useful for static analysis. For example the Dart `analyzer` package can be used to generate an AST of Dart code for mutation testing. This tool lets you load in some code of various languages and build an explorable AST.


## Health
 * [Muscle and Motion](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo0du-IzWuYaVf9QTg10nAQ)
  * I know I find it easy to accidentally use the wrong muscles when doing different exercises, poses, etc. Being able to visualize what's happening and where things should be felt is very helpful for successful execution. The videos also come from [their app](https://www.muscleandmotion.com/)
