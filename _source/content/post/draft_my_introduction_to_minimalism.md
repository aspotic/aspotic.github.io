Minimalism and organized are to related but different things.

Start small and build out. Get a small area cleaned of any clutter that isn't necessary by any means (like dumping things in another room if you really don't know what to do with them) then keep it that way. The night stand and dresser in my case. Habits take time and energy to build, so working iteratively is much easier. As the benefits of having that area tidy start to emerge, it will get easier to keep that area in that state. That's when it's time to start working your way out.

Think about what value things provide and if they are worth having a spot in the house for. Whenever I got to set something down now I think "if this isn't worth putting away, then is it really worth having?". As I've expended throughout the house I've run into things that could be used by someone else, so they now go in the guest bedroom since they sometimes take longer to offload. Things can also go for things you are unsure about getting rid of. It's still there if you really need it, but if you find you never go pull it back out of that room, then it can probably be taken out of the house.

When buying new thing, think about 
- will it be with you forever? If not, will it be so hard to get rid of that it's not worth acquiring?
- are you going to want a bigger/better version of this in a few months? is this the type of thing where it might be better to just get the better version now? Sometimes you don't want the better version now because you need the cheap introduction to truly know whether or not you will want to get more advanced to begin with (like with instruments)
- do you already have things that accomplish this? would this replace that? Is there something else that would allow replacing multiple items already owned?

I've found that reducing the number of items in the house first of all makes organizing much easier, but it also makes home a more relaxing place to be.





Follow the mantra "If you can't be bothered to find a place for it, then do you really need it?"

Is this hurting or helping?


Areas that needed improvement

Phone: mess of apps, shortcuts, panels. Most of which is rarely used. Switched to a minimalist launcher (would eventually like to try living without a phone)

E-mail: Made a label and moved all the emails I wasn't sure what to do with into that. Now when something hits my inbox 

Web Favourites: still needs work

Photo collection: still needs work

House: start small and work out from there. Starting with my office. 
If I can't find a spot for something then it goes into a room I haven't dealt with yet (with the hope that it will fit there).
Once a room is done, then anytime that room is used, need to think "If you can't be bothered to find a place for it, then do you really need it?"
when there's a temptation to cut corners.

Projects: Created a bench for project parts. Finishing a project clears up space for a new one. If there is no space, then there are too many projects so the idea should just be a note somewhere

Purchases:
  Is this an impulse purchase? Don't get tricked by deals and discounts. Just because it's a good deal doesn't mean it's valuable
  Is there an acceptable place for it in the house? If not, then can it replace something in the house?
  Will it replace an existing item? If so, the existing item needs to have an exit plan and be removed
  Does it have its own exit plan? If it's going to be too much work to get rid of then it's not worth getting
