Yield:
1 - 9x13 inch dish

2 cups white sugar
 
1 ½ cups corn syrup
 
2 cups heavy cream
 
1 cup butter
 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Step 1
Butter a 9x13 inch dish.

In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, 1 cup cream and butter. Bring to a boil, stirring often, then stir in remaining 1 cup cream. Heat, without stirring, to 242 degrees F (116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla, and pour into prepared dish. Refrigerate.
