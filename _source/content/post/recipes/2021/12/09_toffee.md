 Yield: 1 1/2 cups

 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Then, add the sugar and salt and whisk until combined. Continue whisking for about 10 minutes, or until the mixture looks like melted peanut butter (reference the picture below).
Pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet, allowing it to spread. Let cool for about 20 minutes.
Use a mallet, rolling pin, or heavy object to crack the toffee into small bits.
You can now use your toffee pieces in cookies, brownies, streusel toppings, sprinkled on top of vanilla ice cream, you name it!

Just 3 ingredients and 15 minutes and you have DIY homemade toffee bits from scratch! They’re absolutely amazing in cookies, brownies, streusel toppings on muffins or pies, or just as a sweet snack.
Ingredients
1 stick (113 grams) unsalted American butter*
1 cup (200 grams) light brown sugar
1 teaspoon fine salt
Directions
Line a small rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
In a heavy bottomed small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sugar and salt and whisk vigorously for one minute until combined. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture looks like melted peanut butter and a thermometer reaches 295 to 305°F, about 10 minutes.
If the mixture separates at all, remove from heat and whisk vigorously until recombined. Return to heat and continue cooking.
Immediately and carefully pour the hot toffee onto the prepared baking pan, allowing it to spread. Let cool and harden for about 20 minutes.
Place the sheet of toffee on a cutting board or in a zip top bag. Use a mallet, rolling pin, or heavy object to crack it into small pieces. You can also cut into bits with a sharp serrated knife. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
Recipe Notes
*Don’t use European-style butter (82% butterfat+) in this recipe. It contains too much butterfat and will cause the toffee to separate.
