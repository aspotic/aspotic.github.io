Follow the mantra "If you can't be bothered to find a place for it, then do you really need it?"

Is this hurting or helping?


Areas that needed improvement

Phone: mess of apps, shortcuts, panels. Most of which is rarely used. Switched to a minimalist launcher (would eventually like to try living without a phone)

E-mail: Made a label and moved all the emails I wasn't sure what to do with into that. Now when something hits my inbox 

Web Favourites: still needs work

Photo collection: still needs work

House: start small and work out from there. Starting with my office. 
If I can't find a spot for something then it goes into a room I haven't dealt with yet (with the hope that it will fit there).
Once a room is done, then anytime that room is used, need to think "If you can't be bothered to find a place for it, then do you really need it?"
when there's a temptation to cut corners.

Projects: Created a bench for project parts. Finishing a project clears up space for a new one. If there is no space, then there are too many projects so the idea should just be a note somewhere

Purchases:
  Is this an impulse purchase? Don't get tricked by deals and discounts. Just because it's a good deal doesn't mean it's valuable
  Is there an acceptable place for it in the house? If not, then can it replace something in the house?
  Will it replace an existing item? If so, the existing item needs to have an exit plan and be removed
  Does it have its own exit plan? If it's going to be too much work to get rid of then it's not worth getting
