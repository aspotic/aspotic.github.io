Lost the magslider for an yeti mug. Decided this would be a good first project for learning epoxy resin art.

# Tools and Materials
* [Existing magslider](yeti.com/en_US/accessories/replacement-magslider/21070100003.html)
  * Fortunately for me, I had access to another mag slider that could be duplicated. For some reason magsliders can't be bought in Canada
* [ComposiMold](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01NBMEKWA/)
  * This is a reusable mold product. Typical silicone molds are can't be melted down and reshaped, but this can be
* [Alcohol Ink](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B082G557CR)/[Mica Powder](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B082QVPNZD)/[Glitter](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08DHVSNLN)/etc.
   * For decoration. The actual art part! I used mica powder for this project
* [Epoxy](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07YDZKXW2)
   * Food safe, Quick set, Clear, Non toxic are things to look for. Be careful because adding colorant could cause the curing process to become toxic
* [Mold Release](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B005T6GTGO)
  * I did not need to use mold release, but you may want it. I could tear apart my mold since it would just be melted down again
* [Vacuum Chamber](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08FRD5648)
  * Not required, but will result in an easier finishing process
* [Dremel](https://www.amazon.ca/Dremel-4000-2-30-120-Volt-Variable/dp/B002L3RUVG)
  * or another way to sand and polish
* [Small Canning Jars](https://www.amazon.ca/Tebery-Canning-Regular-Chalkboard-Included)
  * or other small container

# Making the Mold
Since I have the composimold product, my first step was to take a puck of mold material, stick it in a canning jar, throw it in a pot of boiling water, and let it all melt.

Once melted, you'll want to get another mason jar that has some cling wrap/foil/wax paper in it and you can use the magnet in the magslider to attach it to a string that holds it in place within the compound while it solidifies

Pour the mold compound into the cling wrap jar, then carefully lower the magslider into it and secure it in place with the top flush with the top of the compound

I don't have a vacuum chamber yet, but I would suggest putting mason jar in one to pull the bubbles out of the mold compound. Not doing so will mean having to remove some lumps off the epoxy product

Let it dry! Probaby just an hour or so. I didn't quite wait long enough, and the epoxy mixed a bit with the mold material for my first attempt

Once it's dry, then the magslider can be peeled out. Since the mold was in the cling wrap, you can drop it out of the mason jar easily

# Pouring the Resin
mix resin
add color
potentially layer the resin
pour into mold
make sure it's level
let it set
repeat with any other desired layers

# Add the magnet
drill out a hole on the base
put a small neodymium magnet in (proper polarity so it will attach to the lid)
pour some more resin on the magnet
let it set

# Finish the magslider
slice of any big epoxy bubbles with an exacto knife
use a fine grit wet sandpaper to clean up the epoxy
polish the magslider with polish compound or a heat treatment
