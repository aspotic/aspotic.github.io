This is  my experience with overcoming the body problems that have come with 15 years of software development
<!--more-->

The last couple years I've been dealing with some pretty rough problem related to looking at a monitor all day and sitting at a desk. After a lot of appointments, reasearch, and practice, I think I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully I can help you avoid some of these issues. If you just want the summary of what to do, head on down to "Getting back on track"

## Deciphering the problems

So it turns out the body is a ridiculously complicated system. So many things interact with each other, so it's very hard to isolate things or find the root cause of something. Kind of like a legacy monolith.

## Getting back on track

1. Move frequently. When sitting at a desk all day you end up with a body that is constantly being optimized for sitting at a desk. This isn't a good thing! It means reducing muscle activity, reducing mobility in some places, introducing hypermobility in other places. I now have a program that tells me every 15min to move, and every hour to get up for a 5min walk or mini yoga session. You don't even have to break your mental models with the 15min reminder, it will just help you stop holding your body in a static position for too long. I also don't like just using a standing desk or just using a sitting desk anymore. It's the variation that's critical. Standing is even worse than sitting if you're standing without movement for too long because the ability to hold a healthy posture becomes impossible, and standing means more muscles/ligaments/fascia that can get messed up

2. Exercise mindfully. Learning about your muscles and visualizing how you want to move the ones you're working on will help so much with getting decent activation. Slowly and methodically moving tension around your body can be helpful for finding muscle imbalances and figuring out the movements needed to re-awaken unused muscles (this is kind of like pandiculation). Some muscles may even require you to place your hand on them to get enough sensory feedback to find and activate a muscle. Learning meditation and how to breath correctly will also aid significantly here because of the relaxation effect those two things can have on the body. This relaxation ability is important for helping to relax muscles that are too tight.

3. Sit/Stand mindfully.

4. Rolling things out.

5. Consistency. No pain doesn't mean nothing is wrong, especially for recovery vs preventative measures

6. Adapt your workstation. Keyboard, mouse, foot pedals, sit/stand/treadmill, monitor

7. Intermittent fasting. Great for healing the body (unless you have an eating disorder, then please don't try this)

8. De-stress. Yoga, Meditation (meditation, running, etc can be meditation), 1:2 breating, etc. Stress manifests physically and taking these measures to de-stress will increase the awareness of the tension built up by stress. Having an awareness of this stress tension will make it easier to nip it in the bud in the future because it will be easier to notice when it starts happening.

9. Learn how your muscles work
