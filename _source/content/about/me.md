Hi! I'm Adam and I hope you can get some value out of the collection of information I'm building here. 
I'm currently a Senior Software Development Engineer in Test with Workiva during the day and during the evenings I'm learning about a variety of subjects, relaxing, or honing some kind of skill.
I would like to keep primarily focused on software development, but photography and cooking are going to 
show up a lot too.
