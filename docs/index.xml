      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Adam and I hope you can get some value out of the collection of information I&amp;rsquo;m building here. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Software Development Engineer in Test with Workiva during the day and during the evenings I&amp;rsquo;m learning about a variety of subjects, relaxing, or honing some kind of skill. I would like to keep primarily focused on software development, but since this is the About section, I&amp;rsquo;ll list the other things that might come up every once in a while and below is a timeline of my experience with development.</description>
