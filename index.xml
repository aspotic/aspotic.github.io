      <description>This is a list of the various tools I have found helpful over the years
Software Development  AST Explorer  An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree of source code where the top is the whole file, the bottom are the smallest pieces like primitive variables, and the rest is in between. ASTs are very useful for static analysis. For example the Dart analyzer package can be used to generate an AST of Dart code for mutation testing.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Adam and I hope you can get some value out of the collection of information I&amp;rsquo;m building here. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Software Development Engineer in Test with Workiva during the day and during the evenings I&amp;rsquo;m learning about a variety of subjects, relaxing, or honing some kind of skill. I would like to keep primarily focused on software development, but since this is the About section, I&amp;rsquo;ll list the other things that might come up every once in a while.</description>
